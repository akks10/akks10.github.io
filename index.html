    Claustrum Capital is an AI-native long/short and activist hedge fund grounded in fundamental value investing, built to create edge by using AI to discover new strategies, not just accelerate existing ones. We use an agentic orchestration engine to fuse fragmented signals into coherent, testable theses most teams never assemble - linking disclosure micro-changes, supplier and contract language, regulatory traces, and peer behavior into a single view. In activist situations, the same system compresses the full campaign cycle from weeks to hours: evidence building, shareholder mapping, outcome trees, anticipating objections, and a disciplined execution playbook, ultimately converting insight, attention, and speed into a durable competitive advantage.
